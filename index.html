    <h1>Udacity JavaScript Arcade Game</h1>
    <div id="game"></div>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player around the game.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to reach the water without colliding with a bug.</p>
    <p>Every time you achieve your goal, you go up a level and another enemy is added.</p>
    <p>Your browser will remember your high score, so come back and try a beat it.</p>
    <p>Try collecting the green gems to see what they do.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about">This is a project I completed that was provided by Udacity. Details of the project
        can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true">here</a>.
        You can see all the extra code I have written to get the game to work by browsing through
        the commits in the GitHub
        <a href="https://github.com/SteveWooding/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game">repository</a>.
        The game graphics and engine was provided, but I got the enemies and player to appear,
        wrote the game logic and added various features like lives and levels.</p>
